<h1>I’m @TheSpiritWolf13</h1> A <b>senior electrical engineering student</b> interested in the area of <i>electronics, embedded systems and control systems</i>.

- My interests range from system design and development to software applications and data analysis.
- I’m currently improving over my abilities to code in <b>Verilog</b> for FPGA applications and online backend development.
- I don't particularly like the idea of tying myself to a single coding language so you can expect me to reach beyond my comfort zone to try new programming languages and software.
- As an electrical engineering student I would be interested in colaborating with projects related to electronics or software that would aid in simulations.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I like to participate in Game Jams hosted in Itch.io. Recently I participated in the Pirate Software Game Jam using Godot as engine and GDScript language.
